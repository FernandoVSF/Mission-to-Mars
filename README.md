# Mission to Mars
Web Scraping with HTML/CSS

  
## Overview of the project
Complete Mars scrapping by including all four of the hemisphere images. To do this, we used BeautifulSoup and Splinter to scrape full-resolution images of Marsâ€™s hemispheres and the titles of those images, store the scraped data on a Mongo database, use a web application to display the data, and alter the design of the web app to accommodate these images.  The following outputs will be produced:

- Scrape Full-Resolution Mars Hemisphere Images and Titles
- Update the Web App with Mars Hemisphere Images and Titles
- Add Bootstrap 3 Components
